# Cervical Cancer Detection using CNNs and VGG16 Module - TensorFlow

This repository implements a deep learning approach for cervical cancer detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the VGG16 architecture. It provides a complete pipeline for preprocessing medical imaging data, training the VGG16 model, and evaluating its performance.

## Features

- Utilizes **transfer learning** with the VGG16 pre-trained model for feature extraction and fine-tuning.
- Comprehensive workflow: data preprocessing, training, validation, and evaluation.
- Medical imaging-focused: designed to handle cervical cancer datasets efficiently.
- Results visualization, including confusion matrices, accuracy, and loss curves.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Additional libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankurkohli007/Cervical-Cancer-Detection-CNNs-VGG16-module-.git
   cd Cervical-Cancer-Detection-CNNs-VGG16-module-
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. To use the cervical cancer detection system, follow these steps:
- **Prepare your data:**:
   - The dataset used here is Herlev Dataset.
   - Organize your dataset into train and test directories with subdirectories for each class label.

2. **Run the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the provided notebook file and follow the step-by-step instructions to:
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Load the VGG16 model with pre-trained weights.
   - Train and evaluate the model.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Visualize results such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize and resize medical images.
   - Augment data to enhance model generalization.

2. **Model Design and Training**:
   - Use VGG16 with fine-tuning to adapt to the cervical cancer dataset.
   - Implement training loops with early stopping to avoid overfitting.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate performance on a validation/test dataset.
   - Generate visualizations for better interpretability.
